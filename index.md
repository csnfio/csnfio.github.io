## Getting Started

There are three key personas that interact with CSNF.  These are defined as follows and illustrated in the following diagram. Get started information for each of these personas is covered after the diagram.    
1. **Producers.** Include cloud service providers (CSPs) and cloud and on-prem data providers that generate logs as well as security findings or events or alerts. Some examples include Azure, AWS, Google, Oracle, IBM as CSPs and Palo Alto, Cisco, Qualys, etc. 
1. **Consumers.** Include consuming products like SIEM and SOAR and enterprises that use these products or directly integrate with the producers using home grown tools or services. Some examples include Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, Google Chronicle, etc. as consuming products and Cigna, Intuit, FedEx, etc. as enterprise consumers. 
1. **ONUG Open Community.** Brings together producers, consumers and cybersecurity experts like MITRE, NIST, etc. and establishes governance and standardization principles. ONUG enables productization of standards and enable a connected open community of standards. Key goal is to enable easy way for enterprises to work in the multi-cloud world with standardized and enriched information. This CSNF GitHub enables connecting producers and consumers to connect with CSNF.
